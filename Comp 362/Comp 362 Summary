Examination of the principal types of systems including batch, multiprogramming, and time-sharing. 
Networked systems are also discussed. 
The salient problems associated with implementing systems are considered including interrupt or event driven systems, multi-tasking, storage and data base management, and input-output.
Emphasis will be placed on some of the simple algorithms used to solve common problems encountered such as deadlocks, queue service, and multiple accesses to data. 
Projects will be implemented to reinforce the lectures.
